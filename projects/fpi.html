<h1>Robotic Abrasive Cloth Flap Wheel Polishing Project</h1>

<p>The surface quality of the blade has a significant impact on the performance of jet engines. As the final finishing process in the blade production line, polishing employs specialized tools to reduce surface roughness while preserving the original geometry of the blade, enhancing its overall surface quality. This project aims to develop a robotic polishing system specifically designed for the complex leading and trailing edges of the blade, improving its surface finish quality.</p>
