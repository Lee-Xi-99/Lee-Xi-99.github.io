<h1>AI-based Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection Project</h1>

<p>The quality of blade manufacturing significantly influences the overall operational performance of the engine. This project proposes an AI-based detection framework to detect minor defects on jet-engine blade surfaces through fluorescent penetrant.
