# URSP Blade Machining Project

This project aims to reduce surface roughness and enhance compressive residual stress in titanium alloy aero-engine blades utilizing the low-plasticity ultrasonic rolling strengthening process (URSP) on a customized 5-axis CNC platform. Due to the multifactorial complexity of the process and the limited availability of irregular test samples, an optimization algorithm suitable for small sample sizes is required.
