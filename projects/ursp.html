<h1>URSP Blade Machining Project</h1>

<p>This project aims to enhance the surface integrity of aero-engine blades by integrating cooled air minimum quantity lubrication (CAMQL) technology with the low-plasticity ultrasonic rolling strengthening process (URSP) on a customized 5-axis CNC platform.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“Š Key Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a sophisticated five-axis CNC-driven blade machining platform integrating low-plasticity URSP.</li>
  <li>Employed various analytical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and thermocouple pyrometry, to investigate the formation mechanism of surface integrity in aero-engine blade materials and analyzed the intricate multi-field coupling actions in low-plasticity URSP.</li>
  <li>Constructed a comprehensive database for the low-plasticity URSP intensification process parameters. Applied optimization techniques to refine process parameters for enhanced surface integrity and mechanical properties.</li>
</ul>
