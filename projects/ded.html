<h1>Online Visual Monitoring and Process Parameter Optimization Project</h1>

<p>The additive manufacturing process is always characterized by geometrical variations in the printed part, such as over-fusion, lack of fusion, expansion, and contraction, all of which can compromise print quality. Therefore, determining the optimal process parameters is essential to achieving superior surface quality of the workpiece. This project aims to capture the geometric model of the workpiece during processing, enabling real-time assessment of the processing state and accuracy, as well as developing additive manufacturing prototypes that integrate online topology optimization with closed-loop control of process parameters.</p>
