<h1>Automatic Detection Project</h1>

<p>The wear conditions of honeycomb sealing rings in aerospace engines are often complex. This project aims to achieve automated detection for the geometric features of wear marks on honeycomb sealing structures based on depth ratio features. It also involves adaptive identification and quantitative analysis of cellular wear through point cloud data processing.</p>
