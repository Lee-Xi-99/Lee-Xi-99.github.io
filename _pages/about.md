<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received a master of science in control science and engineering from Xinjiang University in 2023 and a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and automation from Hainan University in 2018. My research interests include **deep learning**, **smart materials**, and **additive manufacturing**. I have authored or co-authored four peer-reviewed publications, primarily in reputable international engineering journals such as ***Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing* (IF = 11.4)** and ***Measurement* (IF = 5.6)**.
