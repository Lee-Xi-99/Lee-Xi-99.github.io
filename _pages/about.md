<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I earned a Master of Science in Control Science and Engineering from Xinjiang University in 2023 and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Hainan University in 2018.

My research interest includes deep learning, smart materials, and additive manufacturing. I have published 4 papers. (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MnE2NHgAAAAJ'>).
